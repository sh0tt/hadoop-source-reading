<!-- 

This file defines the mappings from username to comma seperated list
of directories/files that the user is allowed to use. One mapping
per user. Wildcard characters, such as "*" and "?", are not recognized. 
For example, to match "/output" directory, one can use "/output" or 
"/output/", but not "/output/*". Any leading or trailing whitespaces 
in the name field are stripped/ignored, while only leading whitespaces 
in the value field are. Note that the special hdfsproxy admin user "Admin"
doesn't automatically have access to any files, unless explicitly 
specified in this file. Usernames can only comprise of 0-9a-zA-Z and 
underscore.
